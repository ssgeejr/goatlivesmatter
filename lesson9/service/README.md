# LESSON 8

## Putting it all together

We've covered a lot of things ... web apps, java, mysql, database connectivity, sql, queries, tables, updates, inserts, deletes and last was value objects.   
Now what we need to do is start putting everythign weve learned into a practical practice.  
I'll be back Monday and we can whiteboard the complicated items ... until then, the following outlines what to do to get started on lesson8  

* Switch to branch lesson8
* use the stubbed out project to create a web-app (you don't need any content ... just stub out the pages as defined below)  
	* (using index.jsp) create and add a logo
	* add three links in a menu-bar fasion (you'll have to find something and create it: KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid)
		* Home (the link that takes you to the hope page (index.jsp)
		* Services (a link that takes you to 'services.jsp) 
		* About (link to about.jsp) 
		* Contact Us (contact.jsp)
		* Login (login.jsp) 
	* All of these pages need to use a single style-sheet: efn.css this Style-Sheet should contain 
		* borders
		* fonts
		* colors
		* links 
		* anything cool you think we need


You don't have to write anything in the pages, just create a logo and using a table, create the menu and body of the webpage
If you want an example, just look at http://pasedb.org 
You can run this in tomcat - that is where you can test it. 

Message me on slack for any questions. 

Good luck ... this is a real-life project.  Remember -- you are only stubbing the pages, we'll add content later and we will be using everything you learned with the database and value object to have people contact us and for "users" to "login" 

You got this ... here is where it get's really good!!!
